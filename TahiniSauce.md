### Ingredients:

- Tahini(~ 200 g)
- Lemon(~2)
- Garlic(~1 head)(You can skip peeling and degerming to save time with minimal loss of flavor)
- Cumin
- Salt
- Icy cold water

### Steps:

1. Add the cumin to the spice grinder and blitz.
2. Add all the garlic with the juice of 2 lemons into the spice grinder and blitz until the garlic is mostly combined and the liquid turns white. Pass through a fine mesh sieve and discard the solids.
3. And the tahini to the garlic flavored lemon juice in the food processor and mix. This will turn thicker as you mix and form a stiff paste.
4. Slowly add icy cold water while the food processor is running until it forms a loose creamy paste of mayonnaise consistency.
5. Add salt to taste and run the food processor to combine.
6. Can be served with falafel and other fried food, keeps for several months in the refrigerator.


### Tips:
* If the tahini mixture seems to seize up, add an ice cube to the food processor when mixing, this should slowly return it back to a creamy state
