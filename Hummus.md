### Ingredients:

- Chickpeas(unsoaked) (~ 1 cup)
- Tahini(~ 200 g)
- Lemon(~2)
- Garlic(~1 head)(You can skip peeling and degerming to save time with minimal loss of flavor)
- Cumin(Optional)
- Salt
- Extra Virgin Olive oil(The best you can find, this is the place to splurge) (1/3 cup + serving)
- Baking Soda

### Steps:

1. Soak chickpeas overnight.
2. Boiling chickpeas
    * Sauce pot
    Simmer chickpeas in a covered sauce pot with some salt and a tsp of baking soda to help the skin release. For best results, do this one a medium low heat for close to an hour. Skim off any starch that threatens to leave the pot. The chickpeas should hold their shape but press into a paste without much resistance.
    * Pressure Cooker
    Pressure cook the soaked chickpeas with baking soda and salt for 40-50 minutes. The chickpeas should hold their shape but press into a paste without much resistance.
3. Drain the chickpeas and refrigerate the water asap. Run the chickpeas under cold water and skim the loose chickpea skin. Repeat until most of the chickpea skins are removed. Leave to rest in a colander. Save few chickpeas for serving.
4. Blitz all the garlic with the juice of 2 lemons until the garlic is mostly combined and the liquid turns white, add ground cumin here if desired. Pass through a fine mesh sieve and discard the solids.
5. And the tahini to the garlic flavored lemon juice in the food processor and mix. This will turn thicker as you mix and form a stiff paste.
6. Slowly add the cold chickpea water(mix with cold water if not cold already) to this paste and mix until it has the consistency of a thick batter.
7. Add the chickpeas to a food processor and purée the mixture. Add a 1/3 cup of olive oil and salt to taste and purée it again until homogenized.
8. Serve dressed with olive oil and with the chickpeas on top.
9. Best paired with onion/radish quick pickle, olives, labneh, and fresh bread.


### Tips:
* If the tahini mixture seems to seize up, add an ice cube to the food processor when mixing, this should slowly return it back to a creamy state
