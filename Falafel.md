Tags: Snack, Fried, Arabian


### Ingredients:

- 225g dried chickpeas
- 2 ounces picked fresh cilantro, parsley, or mint leaves, or preferably a mixture of all three (about 2 cups; 55g)
- 6 scallions, white and pale green parts only, sliced (about 2 ounces; 55g)
- 2 medium cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons; 10ml)
- 1 teaspoon (about 4g) ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon (about 2g) ground coriander seed
- 2 teaspoons (about 10g) kosher salt, plus more for seasoning
- vegetable oil for frying

### Steps:

1. Soak chickpeas overnight.
2. Drain, rinse and dry the chickpeas thoroughly.
3. Combine chickpeas, herbs, scallions, garlic, cumin, coriander, and salt in a food processor. Pulse until chickpeas are very finely minced.
4. Transfer mixture to a bowl, cover, and place in refrigerator for 15 minutes to allow time for more starch to seep out of chickpeas.
5. Preheat oil to 375 F for deep-frying.
6. Form tablespoon sized balls of the falafel mixture and gently lower into the oil one by one.
7. Allow to cook undisturbed until well browned before flipping.
8. After about 4 minutes of total cook time, transfer the cooked falafel onto a paper towel-lined tray and season with salt.
9. Serve immediately with tahini sauce and/or hummus on the side.
